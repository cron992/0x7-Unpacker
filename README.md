# 0x7 Unpacker
0x7 Unpacker is an open-source deobfuscator for 0x7 Obfuscator (Old Version of Inx Obfuscator, mainly pasted from ConfuserEx). License: MIT.

This is my first time making an unpacker, excuse the messy code.

## Usage
Compile
Drag and Drop Packed assembly onto Compiled Unpacker exe

## Fully Supported Protections
 * Anti Dump
 * Strings Encoding (Compress / encode strings) XOR can be decrypted with de4dot, therefore it was not added.
 * Int Math
 * Constants Outliner (Strings & Int)
 * Reference Proxy
 * Constant Mutation - Use TheProxy Mutation Cleaner

## Semi - Supported Protections
 * AntiVM - Only works without CFLOW

## Todo / Currently Adding 
 * Control Flow - Low is supported but not included. Max will be the next done, nothing in-between for now.
 * Local To Field
